<p>After watching <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, I've been a bit bothered about Joi. You see a picture like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2018-1-7-joi/joi.jpg" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>and I kind of wonder - was she just a toy? Something to distract K from the loneliness of his life, to give him at least some sense of purpose? <em>Everything you want to hear, to see</em> - is she just some device that we can use to gain a glimpse of K's soul? (Yes, he does have a soul, as both <em>Blade Runner </em>films will tell) In that form, she's just a mirror image of K, or a manifestation of his unconscious, whatever way you look at it.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't really thematically fit <em>Blade Runner </em>- Joi must be more than that. The films showed us replicants are human (or close enough) - why not holograms? One thing is for certain though - if we've learned anything from the franchise, it's that the eyes are immensely important, and therefore the Joi we see in the above photo is dead, lifeless - soulless. Her eyes are just empty brown slits. In the words of Mariette: "There's nothing inside."</p>
<p>Is that the end of all hope, then? I think one big clue lies in another Joi advertisement, shown during the K-Joi-Mariette love scene:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2018-1-7-joi/ad.png"/></p>
<p>We see a very similar advertisement, but in this case, the "Joi" is altogether very alive, her eyes deep and fully fleshed out. I think these two advertisements hint that Joi did, in fact, have a soul, and then lost it, presumably when Luv crushed her transmitter (is that what you call it?) (Luv crushing Joi - I wonder if Denis has some martial problems or anything like that). The leftover "Joi" we see in the final advertisement is her soulless body.</p>
<p>Throughout the film, we also constantly see Joi trying to transcend her immaterial form. Remember the ad: "Everything you want to hear, to see". What about feel or touch? Yet, Joi constantly attempts to touch K and ultimately become real in the world - see the rain scene, or the love scene. I believe this is a clear example of free will - she's breaking from her programming in order to become a better companion to K. Joi even expresses jealousy over Mariette - something you probably wouldn't program your holographic companion to have. Thus, if anything, Joi is human - and therefore she has a soul.</p>
